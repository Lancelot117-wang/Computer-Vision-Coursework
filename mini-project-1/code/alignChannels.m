function [imShift, predShift] = alignChannels(im, maxShift)
% ALIGNCHANNELS align channels in an image.
%   [IMSHIFT, PREDSHIFT] = ALIGNCHANNELS(IM, MAXSHIFT) aligns the channels in an
%   NxMx3 image IM. The first channel is fixed and the remaining channels
%   are aligned to it within the maximum displacement range of MAXSHIFT (in
%   both directions). The code returns the aligned image IMSHIFT after
%   performing this alignment. The optimal shifts are returned as in
%   PREDSHIFT a 2x2 array. PREDSHIFT(1,:) is the shifts  in I (the first) 
%   and J (the second) dimension of the second channel, and PREDSHIFT(2,:)
%   are the same for the third channel.
